# CryptX (App)

📱 A cross-platform Flutter application for tracking and visualising cryptocurrency — built to help users stay on top of the crypto market, follow their crypto information performance, and make more informed decisions.

## 🎯 Features

* Real-time crypto market data (prices, trends, volume, etc).
* Multi-platform support: Android, iOS.
* Clean, modern UI with intuitive navigation and theming.
* Responsive layouts for different device sizes (mobile).
* Plug-and-play Flutter project structure — easy for further customization and feature expansions.

## 🧭 Why this app?

If you're actively tracking cryptocurrencies and want a unified, beautifully-designed Flutter app (rather than juggling multiple web dashboards or separate mobile apps), CryptX gives you that foundation:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio)
* Optional: device/emulator for mobile testing OR browser for Web
* Optional: configure desktop targets if you want Windows/macOS/Linux support

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chris-Eminence/cryptx-app.git
cd cryptx-app
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **(Optional) If you're targeting mobile, run:**

```bash
flutter run
```


4. Explore the code in `lib/` .

### Development Notes

* The main codebase lives in `lib/`.
* You'll find assets (images/icons) under `assets/png/`.
* Platform-specific configuration is under the respective platform folders (e.g., `android/`, `ios/`).
* To add new features, consider using a modular folder structure for maintainability (for example: `ui/`, `widgets/`, `models/`, `services/`).
* For state management, pick your preferred package (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc) and plug into the architecture.

## 🧩 Architecture & Tech Stack

* **Flutter** (uses Dart) — one codebase for all target platforms.
* **Material Design** UI with responsive layouts.
* **Cross-platform** configuration already present (android, ios).
* **Pubspec** defines dependencies; you can update/add as needed.
